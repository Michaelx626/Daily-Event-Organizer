 <h1 align="center"> Daily Event Organzier </h1>

<h2 align="center"> Project Description </h2>
<p align="center"> This project helps users log his or her event throughout the day. There is an indication whether the event is past, present and/or future as well. The project will reset every day at 12AM giving the user a clean and user friendly experience. Throughout this project, I learned to get familiar with JQuery and to see the difference from vanilla JavaScript versus JQuery. In addition I got to use DayJS to retrieve real time data of our time and date. I got to experience the different format of using event listeners, query selectors using JQuery. </p>
